# OxidationEngine

A 3D graphics engine using Rust and Vulkan. A mild port from my C-based 3d-engine, RolyPolyEngine, though the idea
is to create a safer experience whilst trying to keep performance respectable. Also hoping that using a higher
level language will allow for greater productivity, allowing for more concepts (both Vulkan and general programming) to be tried out.

## Rationale

To become more proficient in Rust, with the idea to try and keep the code as "safe" as possible.
